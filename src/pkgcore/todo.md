# TODO

## snakeoil

- Remove `distutils_extenstions` support

## pkgcore

- When generating docs, we should use `docs` instead of `help`, similar to how
  is works in `pkgcheck` and `pkgdev`

- Add more typing into the code - waits for python 3.9 minimal version support

- Move to `flit` (with custom backend that wraps `flit_core`)

## pkgcheck

## pkgdev
